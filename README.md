## üß† OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | How it's applied                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | User data (PIN, balance) is private and accessed through public methods         |
| **Abstraction**   | Interface `AccountOperations` can be used to abstract account-related methods   |
| **Polymorphism**  | Methods like `withdraw()` can be overridden or varied for account types         |
